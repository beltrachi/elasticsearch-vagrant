Creates a Ubuntu VM with elasticsearch. By default uses 1GB of memory.

Requires:

* VirtualBox
* Vagrant 

Basic usage:

The VM can be started by running `vagrant up` from within the project directory.
It can be stopped with `vagrant halt`, destroyed with `vagrant destroy` and provisioned with `vagrant provision`. Standard vagrant stuff.
